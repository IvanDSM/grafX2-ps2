Hi, this is IvanDSM. This is my proof-of-concept port of GrafX2 to the PS2.

I can't get it to build due to a nasty linking error regarding the link function in newlib:
Linking ../bin/grafx2-sdl
/usr/local/ps2dev/ee/lib/gcc-lib/ee/3.2.3/../../../../ee/lib/libc.a(linkr.o)(.text+0x24): In function `_link_r':
../../../../../newlib/libc/reent/linkr.c: undefined reference to `link'

This proof-of-concept is very hacky. I did it in a few hours, and I am pretty sure it is unable to load or save files. Heck, I don't even know if it'll actually boot!

There's a few things you need to know before messing with this. 
The first of them is that I have disabled TTF and Lua support in the makefile.Wwe can probably get them working after we get the proof-of-concept to boot!
The second and MOST IMPORTANT of them is that you'll need to add the stdint.h file that is in this folder to your PS2SDK. Copy it to your $PS2SDK/ee/include/. In my system, the path is /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/ee/include/.

After you do that, run make inside the grafX2 folder and all should work!

Good luck fixing the linking bug :)
