While the sourcecode is currently hosted on
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/GrafX2/grafX2/), the bugtracker and developer docs
are hosted on [Trac](http://pulkomandy.tk/projects/GrafX2).

Drive your browser there for a lot of useful information on GrafX2 development,
internals, and roadmap.

You can also join the #grafx2 channel on Freenode for more direct interaction
with other developers.
