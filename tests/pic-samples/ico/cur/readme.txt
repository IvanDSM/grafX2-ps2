Author's decription:

Classic Windows cursors with built-in shadows and antialiased edges. This set contains all classic cursors and three alternative ones (pendulum arrow, lightbulb, and animated unavailable sign).

If you are using this set on Vista Beta 2, be sure to disable cursor shadow in control panel. The cursors already contain shadows.
