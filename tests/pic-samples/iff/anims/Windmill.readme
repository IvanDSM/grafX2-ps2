Short: MThompson anim of a grass field
Type: gfx/anim

This is a 100 frame test animation I did as a proof of concept for a
technique I developed to simulate tall grass blowing in the wind.
The method used to create it are described in articles I wrote for
Amiga Video/Graphics and a new publication, LightWave Pro (put out
by the VTU people). It was done with LightWave 3.0 and took about
10mins per frame with antialiasing at 752x480 resolution on a 33MHz
Zeus equipped 2000.
